> Using APIs and other web sources to combine datasets.

### Data Wrangling
This project was completed to showcase my data collection, integration, and analysis skills for my Data Wrangling final project at the University of Iowa.

### Prerequisites
The project was completed using RStudio and the RSocrata API, so users must have RStudio installed and an RSocrata account to access their API. RSocrata is an API that can be installed and uploaded into RStudio to upload data files from the API's library. 

This repository contains the R Scripts used to collect and analyze the data, as well as the Micrsoft Excel file that was used as the other web source for our data.

### Steps to run the code
1. Download the R Script files and the Microsoft Excel file in the repository.
2. Create an RSocrata account for access to their API.
3. Install necessary R Packages used in the code.
4. If all code is downloaded correcty, the datasets will download and merge, and the analysis will appear in the data_analysis.R file.
